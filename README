
Approach :
1. Input the text file web.txt which consists of different links to different sites.
2. Read all the HTML content from the sites(using lxml module) and remove stop words, non-alpabetic and non-english characters(using nltk.corpus).
3. Map each unique word from step 2 with the web links in which they occur in trei structure(using defaultdictionary)
and count all repeated occurrences for ranking and use Counter to store and sort .
4. Run the python file and search for words.
5. The code will return the list of links in which the input word appears sorted by the number of times it occurs(descending).
